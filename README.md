Capstone Project: Analysis of the Global Terrorism Database
Summary
This project analyzes the Global Terrorism Database (GTD), which provides comprehensive information on terrorist events worldwide. Using Python and libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib, the project aims to uncover patterns and trends in terrorism, examining factors such as the frequency of attacks, types of perpetrators, and the socio-political contexts surrounding these events.

Key Insights
Trend Analysis: The frequency of terrorist attacks has fluctuated over the years, with notable peaks corresponding to specific geopolitical events.

Geographical Patterns: Certain regions, particularly the Middle East and North Africa, experience a higher incidence of terrorism, highlighting ongoing conflicts and instability.

Motivations and Perpetrators: The analysis reveals diverse motivations behind attacks, including political, religious, and ideological factors, with different groups associated with distinct attack types.

Impact Assessment: The severity and impact of terrorist events vary, with bombings being among the deadliest methods, while non-lethal approaches are more common.

Policy Implications: The findings can inform policymakers in developing targeted strategies for counter-terrorism and prevention efforts.

This project emphasizes the value of data-driven approaches in understanding and addressing the complexities of global terrorism.
